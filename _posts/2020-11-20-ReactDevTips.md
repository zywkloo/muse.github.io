## 1. NEVER use !== or != to compare JavaScript objects:

Unless the you are sure every state is immutable or primitive data type, don't do this.
### Big NO NO :  
  ```
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
	...
	for (let key of Object.keys(this.state)) {
		if (nextState[key] !== this.state[key]) {
		return true
		}
	}
	...
	return false
}
  ```

### Yes:
```
import { isEqual } from 'lodash' 

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
	...
	for (let key of Object.keys(this.state)) {
		if (!isEqual(nextState[key], this.state[key])) {
			return true
		 }
	}
	...
}
```
If you don't like 'lodash', use other packages like 'Underscore.js', 'Immutable.js'. if you are not sure which to use, ask your teammate or leader.

Note: React officially recommend 'Immutable.js'.


## 2.  Better setState({}) only when necessary
Technically re-setState the same value in states, won't re-render the native(non-virtual) DOM 
(if I'm wrong, please correct me).
But many states may be passed to the children as their props, which would be a problem. That leads to unnecessary re-rendering.
   
### No good:
  ```
//no checks  
this.setState({ userAudioMap })
   ```
		   
### Better:    
  ```
import { isEqual } from 'lodash' 
...

!isEqual(userAudioMap, this.state.userAudioMap) && this.setState({ userAudioMap })
```

 _or_
  
```
import { isEqual } from 'lodash' 
// better readability
if(!isEqual(userAudioMap, this.state.userAudioMap)){
	this.setState({ userAudioMap }) 
}
 ```

## 3. Aware of state types when using React.PureComponent

React.PureComponentâ€™s shouldComponentUpdate() only shallowly compares the objects.
	
Only extend PureComponent when you expect to have simple props and state, Or, consider using immutable.js (recommended by React) objects to facilitate fast comparisons of nested data.


### Pros:
* Dev don't have to use shouldComponentUpdate explicitly for performance improvement.

### Cons:	
* Due to shallowEquals, it won't compare values in deeper value, so page may not be updated when needed.
* Need to make sure the states are primitive types or "simple" enough.
